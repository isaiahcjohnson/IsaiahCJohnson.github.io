**Course Description**  
This course examines various political controversies that surround the role of race and ethnicity in American society. These controversies and issues affect public opinion, political institutions, political behavior, and salient public policy debates. Thus, this course will assess and evaluate the role of race in each of these domains while also examining historical antecedents.  

The first half of the course focuses on historical antecedents such as the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement. The second half of the course explores the nature of contemporary racial attitudes, particularly in the context of the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections.
