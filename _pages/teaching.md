## Teaching Philosophy

I have gained extensive experience teaching and consulting at Princeton. In 2025, I received the *George Kateb Preceptor Award* for excellence in teaching. I have served as a preceptor for *Race and Politics in the United States*, *Introduction to Quantitative Social Science*, and *Formal Political Analysis I*, and as a Quantitative and Analytical Political Science Fellow and consultant for Princeton Research in Experimental Social Science, where I advised students on research design, formal modeling, and statistical analysis in R.  

My teaching philosophy centers on the idea that education should not be “one size fits all.” I strive to create spaces where students can engage with mathematics, statistical inference, and political methodology in supportive, rigorous, and inclusive ways. I treat mistakes as opportunities for growth and emphasize clarity over jargon, building students’ confidence through application, iteration, and open dialogue.  

In both methods and substantive courses, I work to connect theory and empirical analysis to students’ lived experiences. I aim to foster a collaborative environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, challenge assumptions respectfully, and develop the analytical and conceptual tools necessary to conduct meaningful political research.
