# Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics and a graduate affiliate with the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at Princeton University. I study American politics with a focus on the political economy of race. My research examines how politicians navigate uncertainty when making decisions, particularly in contexts where electoral incentives and racial dynamics intersect. I employ formal theory to model the strategic choices legislators face and use quantitative methods to test these predictions in empirical settings.

My [job market paper](/files/2025-09-05-JMP-Draft.pdf), *Jack of All Trades, Master of None: Multiracial Politicians and Political Representation*, develops a formal model of descriptive representation as an agency problem, showing how uncertainty about racial competence shapes the strategies of Multiracial incumbents. Other projects extend this framework through experimental and historical analyses of racial classification, coalition formation, and political behavior. My published and co-authored work examines topics including presidential bargaining, the emotional expression of Black women candidates, and the strategic logic of enfranchisement in U.S. suffrage politics.

At Princeton, I have taught courses in race and politics, formal theory, and quantitative methods, and I was honored with the George Kateb Preceptor Award for excellence in teaching. I am committed to fostering inclusive and analytically rigorous classrooms and to mentoring students in research design, formal modeling, and data analysis.

I received my B.S. and M.A. in Political Science from the University of Houston in 2019 and 2021.
