Can Multiracial politicians accurately infer Black constituency preferences? I argue that racial competence, or the ability to identify Black communities' policy priorities, depends on contextual knowledge acquired through sustained socialization in Black environments. Because Multiracial Americans are disproportionately raised in racially mixed or majority-White contexts, they may lack the experiential foundation to translate demographic information into accurate policy inferences. I test this using an experiment where Black-White Multiracial and Black Monoracial respondents play incumbent politicians, matching policy positions to district preferences on community policing. Multiracial respondents outperform Monoracial respondents when preferences are directly observable. However, when preferences must be inferred from demographic cues alone, Multiracial respondents show a significant learning disadvantage that widens across repeated decisions. The mechanism is socialization rather than psychological identification: Multiracial respondents with greater exposure to Black social contexts perform significantly better, while politicized racial identity shows no moderating effect. These findings demonstrate that shared racial identity does not guarantee racial competence.
