Do Multiracial politicians possess the contextual knowledge necessary to correctly infer Black constituency preferences? I argue that racial competence, or the ability to identify and act on the policy priorities of Black communities, depends on contextual knowledge acquired through sustained socialization in Black environments. Because Multiracial Americans are disproportionately raised in racially mixed or majority-White contexts, they may lack the experiential foundation necessary to translate demographic information into accurate policy inferences. I test this argument using an original experiment in which Black-White Multiracial and Black Monoracial respondents play a repeated game as incumbent politicians seeking re-election. Respondents must match their policy position to district preferences on community policing as well as Medicare and abortion rights, which serve as placebo issues. I find that Multiracial respondents perform better than Monoracial respondents when constituency preferences are directly observable. However, when preferences must be inferred from demographic cues alone, Multiracial respondents exhibit a significant learning disadvantage that widens across repeated decisions. This deficit emerges specifically for community policing but not for Medicare or abortion, consistent with the domain-specificity of racial competence. Critically, the mechanism is socialization rather than psychological identification: Multiracial respondents with greater exposure to Black social contexts perform significantly better, while politicized racial identity shows no moderating effect. These findings advance theories of descriptive representation by demonstrating that shared racial identity does not guarantee racial competence.
