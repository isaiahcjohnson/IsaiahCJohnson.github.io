How do voters respond when Black women candidates express anger–particularly when that anger is racialized? Using a preregistered survey experiment (N ≈ 5,000) that varied candidate race, gender, and expressions of anger, we test whether Black women are uniquely penalized for displays of anger. We find that when the Black woman candidate expressed anger about racial disparities, support among White respondents dropped by over eight percentage points—with the largest penalty–more than half the vote likelihood scale, coming from racially resentful White men. Even among racially liberal White women, who initially reward non-racialized anger, support collapses once that anger becomes racialized, revealing the fragility of cross-racial gender solidarity. Among Black respondents, intersectionality conscious participants reward the White woman candidate but not the Black woman candidate for racial anger, while Black nationalists reward the Black man candidate and penalize the Black woman candidate for the same expression. Our findings highlight the unique barriers facing Black women candidates in using anger as a political resource.
